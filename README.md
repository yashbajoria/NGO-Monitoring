# NGO-Monitoring
-> Completed the idea of building an entire Web Portal for Monitoring of NGO Activities as a part of NITS HACKS 3.0 Hackathon.<br>
-> Secured the position of 2nd Runners up in the Hackathon, judged by Gaurav Sen and Rachit Jain.<br>
-> The website had numerous features implemented, benefitting both the government and the user NGOs by removing the need for any middleman.<br>
-> The frontend part was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For backend, PHP was used and MySQL Database was used for storing and manipulating the relevant data.<br>
-> Machine Learning libraries were used and deployed through Heroku, for estimation of funds for NGOs.<br>
-> The entire source code has been broken into 2 major modules - **Web part** (used for building the frontend and backend development of Site) and **ML part** (used for building the Api). You can look into the desired code by simply going into respective module.
