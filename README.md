# NGO-Monitoring
Completed the idea of building an entire Web Software for Monitoring of NGO Activities, during my internship tenure of 2 months with **Optum, a United Health Group company**.<br>
The website has numerous features implemented, benefitting both the government and the user NGOs by removing the need for any middleman.<br>
