# NGO-Monitoring
Completed the idea of building an entire Web Software for Monitoring of NGO Activities, during my internship tenure of 2 months with **Optum, a United Health Group company**.<br>
The website has numerous features implemented, benefitting both the government and the user NGOs by removing the need for any middleman.<br>
Visit the original website by clicking the link provided.<br>
Note: It might depict "Deceptive Site Ahead", still one can simply click on "Details" button and further proceed by clicking on "visit this unsafe site".<br>

The entire source code has been broken into 2 major modules - **Web part** (used for building the frontend and backend development of Site) and **ML part** (used for building the Api). You can look into the desired code by simply going into respective module.
